Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree 'Portfolio' project using HTML and CSS

Please note:
1. The github repo for this project also contains some *.txt files. Theses files were created for personal use and taking important notes. They are not a direct part of the project.
2. To see the portfolio web-page in action, download the index.html file along with the js/ and css/ folders. Place all in a folder and open the index.html file in a browser of your choice. You should be able to see the portfolio web-page in all it's glory.
3. The project has been developed using the Twitter's Bootstrap css framework. The rendered page is responsive and works well on IE, Chrome, Firefox and the Opera browsers.
4. Modals powered by bootstrap have been used for the featured works. Just click any of the featured works and expect to see more information related to that work.
5. For lack of time, only placeholder images provided by http://placcehold.it have been used so far.
6. Extensive help has been taken from the 'Into to HTML and CSS' course by Udacity.
